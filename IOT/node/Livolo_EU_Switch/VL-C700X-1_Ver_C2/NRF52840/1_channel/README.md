**Description**

This is the control board for my custom power supply design. No 3rd party modules dependencies - all on a single board and **NRF52840** based.
For touch sensing support I used **Cypress Semiconductor** IC's which are best in class for this purpose.

**Note:**

Initial design was made using **EasyEDA** but was ported to **KiCAD** with the help of the [easyeda2kicad](https://github.com/wokwi/easyeda2kicad) awesome tool. Only the PCB was ported as exporting schematics is not supported yet by the tool.

The only thing I ask if using this project is to at least mention my name and if I don't ask too much you can also support my effort using the below button. Thanks for buying me a beer :).
